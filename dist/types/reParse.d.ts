/**
 * Stringifies and parses back an object, effectively deep cloning it.
 * This method serializes the object into a JSON string and then parses it back into an object.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Note**:
 * - This method is a **simple deep clone** for JSON-serializable objects.
 * - It does **not handle** complex types like functions, `undefined`, `Map`, `Set`, `BigInt`, circular references, etc.
 * - Values like `Date` objects will be serialized as strings.
 *
 * **Alternatives**:
 * - For **deep cloning** an object, consider using a `deepClone` method that supports complex types and preserves all data types.
 * - If your object contains circular references, use a specialized deep cloning library that can handle circular references (such as `lodash.cloneDeep` with circular handling).
 *
 * **Use Cases**:
 * - Useful for **resetting object state** when working with data fetched from APIs or user input.
 * - Helpful when you need to **sanitize** an object, removing properties that are not JSON-serializable.
 * - Best suited for simple data structures where all properties can be safely serialized into JSON.
 *
 * @param obj - The object to stringify and parse.
 * @returns A new object that is a deep copy of the input object.
 *
 * @example
 * const obj = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
 * const newObj = reParse(obj);
 * // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }
